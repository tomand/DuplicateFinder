This is a small program for comparing files. You send in a directory and all subdirectories of that are searched.

The solution contains three projects.

- DuplicateFinder: This is the project that does the file comparison.
- DuplicateFinder.Tests: This is the project for unut tests.
- CompareFiles: This is a console application that runs the comparison.

How to use CompareFiles:
CompareFiles takes up to two arguments.
The first is the path to the directory to search.
The second is optional and is the path to a file in which the result is saved.

CompareFiles "d:\directory to search" "d:\file with the search result"

If the second argument isn't set, the result is written to the console.

What is shown in the result file is a string built like this:
<file Id> : <file path>

Things to do:
- Add more unit tests
- Refactor
